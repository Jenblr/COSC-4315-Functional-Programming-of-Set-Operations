'1_difference' : Changed to use 'filter()' instead of list comprehension since it might violate using 'for' to process lists. 
Additionally, it constructs a new list by recursively filtering out duplicates from the original list list without directly mutating any data

'recursive_search' : Added for intersection and difference

'sorted_results' : Added to recursive sort results of set operation

Implemented some error handling

Implemented display messages within 'result.txt' when empty file exists or difference does not exist

Displayed empty file and such in 'result.txt' per set operation as directed by PDF file

It defines a recursive function to read files, process text, and extract unique words.
It defines a function to perform set operations (union, difference, and intersection).
It defines the main function to parse command-line arguments, read input files, perform set operations, and write the result to a file.
